#### To push to Github

```
git add .

git commit -m "YOUR_COMMIT"

git checkout -b "YOUR_BRANCH"

git push origin "YOUR_BRANCH"

```

After that, you create a pull request to merge your changes into DEVELOP branch (not MAIN branch)

Assign adil to review. Most likely I'll ask you to bump version number.
